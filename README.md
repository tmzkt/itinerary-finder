# itinerary-finder
An itinerary finder that loads data from a Microsoft Access mdb file and outputs an itinerary to to a file named `tripplan.csv`.
This is an older project and there is currently not a sample mdb file available. The program assumes that the input can be read from `C:\Trains.mdb`, but this can be changed by modifying `dataAccess.py`.
The program is written in Python v3.3 and much be executed with a python interpreter.

After installing [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), you can run the app like so:
`"C:\python.exe" "C:\itFinder.py"`
